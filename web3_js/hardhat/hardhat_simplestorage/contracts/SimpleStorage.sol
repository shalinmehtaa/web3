    // Hence, just declaring the variable like uint favouriteNumber; would initialize its value to 0

    // View functions just read the state of the blockchain but do not make any changes to it

    // Stack, Memory, Storage, Calldata, Code, Logs
    // You can only explicitly specify storage location to memory, storage or calldata
    // Calldata and memory mean that the variable is only going to exist temporarily
    // Memory means temporary variables that are mutable, whereas calldata means temporary variables that are not mutable
    // Below, since we do not need the name variable after the function execution, we can store it in memory
    // Storage variables are stored permanently on the blockchain that are mutable
    // Data location can only be (and needs to be specified for function parameters) for arrays, structs and mappings
    // Solidity knows by default where a uint256 variable needs to be stored, but this is not clear for the typed above
    // Strings are just arrays of bytes
